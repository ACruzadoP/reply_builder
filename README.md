If you have ever worked as a Player Support Agent, I'm pretty sure you have noticed that all the prefabs tend to be stored in the same spreadsheet. This presents a few inconveniences that cause the list to never stop increasing. The most important inconveniences are:

    1. It takes too long for the Team Leads to go through all the prefabs in order to remove the unnecesary ones.
    2. It's very likely to end up entering duplicate as well as unnecesary prefabs.

With that said, at certain point the PS agents have to spend long time in order to find the prefab that works better for a specific situation. When I realized about this issue, I thought it would be a good idea to create an Index of prefabs. As soon as I had an Index, I developed two Google Scripts that allowed me to get to the desired prefab as soon as possible.

However, I still had to read and fix the prefab before sending it and that was time consuming. At the time I only had two options:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Use prefabs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Write every reply from scratch. 
  
After having developed this app, a third option started being available:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Write every reply from scratch, using prefabs as well as prewritten sentences. 


A guide will be recorded and provided by me as soon as possible.
