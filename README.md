If you have ever worked as a Player Support Agent, I'm pretty sure you have noticed that all the prefabs tend to be stored in the same spreadsheet. This presents a few inconveniences that cause the list to never stop increasing. The most important inconveniences are:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- It takes too long for the Team Leads to go through all the prefabs in order to remove the unnecesary ones.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- It's very likely to end up entering duplicate as well as unnecesary prefabs.<br /><br />
With that said, at certain point the PS agents have to spend long time in order to find the prefab that works better for a specific situation. When I realized about this issue, I thought it would be a good idea to create an Index of prefabs. As soon as I had an Index, I developed two Google Scripts that allowed me to get to the desired prefab as soon as possible.<br /><br />

However, I still had to read and fix the prefabs before sending them in order to make sure they were working for every situation, and that was time consuming. At the time I only had two options:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Use prefabs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Write every reply from scratch.<br /><br />
After having developed this app, a third option started being available:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Write every reply from scratch, using prefabs as well as prewritten sentences.<br /><br />
Before launching for the first time, you will have to delete the content of "log.txt". Also, the Spreadsheet you will be loading with the app has to be written on a certain way.
